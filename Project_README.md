The file run_analysis.R creates a tidy data set of average measurements based on several data files:
X_train.txt
y_train.txt
subject_train.txt
X_test.txt
y_test.txt
subject_test.txt
features.txt

The script merges the training and test data, labels the measurements with the features,
assigns the subjects to their measurements, and assigns descriptive labels to their activities.

A more detailed explanation of the data manipulation can be found in the Code Book.
